    This SRS is to be written in a formal, technical, and professional tone and must be suitable for academic, enterprise, or government submission. The content should be highly structured, detailed, and elaborate — long enough to span at least 16–18 pages when properly formatted in Word or PDF (11–12 pt font, 1.5 spacing).

    Project Title: ${projectTitle}
    Project Description: ${projectDescription}
    Technology Stack: ${techStack}
    Required Diagrams: ${diagramTypes.join(', ')}
